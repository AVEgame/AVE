# [A]DVENTURE! [V]ILLAINY! [E]XCITEMENT!

AVE: Adventure! Villainy! Excitement! is a text-based game engine
written by Matthew Scroggs.

AVE can currently run on Linux/Mac or on the [EMFCamp Tilda v3 badge](https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MK3).

To build AVE for Linux/Mac, run `./build.py python` in the main directory. To run, enter the `build` directory
and run `./run.py`. To run AVE in debug mode, run `DEBUG=1 ./run.py` or `DEBUG=1 python run.py`.

To build for the badge run `./build.py emf` then copy all files in the `build` directory to `apps/mscroggs~ave` on the badge.

To make your own game for AVE, see `games/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
