You ask for a vodka. The bartender loses count and turns to you, annoyed. Customers begin to look at you, observing how the bartender reacts. He takes a deep breath to calm himself, performs some tai chi moves, and then speaks to you. "What kind of vodka would you like?" he asks.
"I thought you only had one kind of vodka?" => 13
Leave the bar. => 14

You call the recption and request beef sandwiches. A few minutes later you hear footsteps approaching the door. "Room service!" a voice calls as you hear a faint tapping on the door. "I have your beef sandwiches!" You open the door, take the beef sandwiches and sit on the bed. The sandwiches are delicious. The room attendant is still at the door when suddenly the police arrive. "Did you make those sandwiches yourself?" they ask the attendant. She is flustered and can't speak. "These sandwiches were stolen from a different hotel!" they say to you. "And you are under arrest for purchasing stolen goods!" Before you can argue you are in a jail cell with a long sentence ahead of you.

"A cash reward, well why didn't you say so?" => 29

# 19
You hear the sound of a gingerbread biscuit snapping and find yourself next to the ghost in a grand hall. The hall is dark and filled with long empty benches. Tapestries of skeleton warriors winning heroic victories cover the walls. You ask the ghost where you are. "This is the great hall in the skeleton king's castle," she informs you. "Now follow me!" she cries as she begins to leave. Before she leaves, she changes direction and floats through a wall, calling "Help, I'm being pulled by some invisible force! Save me!" You leave the hall and see a staircase and a corridor.

The pavement is covered in ice and snow. "Watch out, there's a murderer on the loose!" a policeman calls to you. You quicken your pace as you return to the hotel.

In the book, a funeral director and a demoralised bus driver combine forces to go on a riverboat trip. It's a fun read, and it inspires you to make your own trip by river. You head to the Amazon and see the beautiful rainforest. Unfortunately you die, killed by obscure waterborne bacteria.

The staircase leads to a large wooden door. Silently, you try the door but it is locked. You see a skeleton guard. He is looking away from you, watching a corridor for intruders. Near to him are a sword and a key.
Take the sword. => 39 + sword
Take the key. => 38 + key

# 31
The corridor is long and poorly lit. No doors lead away from the corridor. After a few minutes you see the light from an approaching flaming torch, and you hear the steps of a large skeleton. There is nowhere to hide so you run back to the hall. The skeleton catches up to you. He is wearing a gold crown and a red velvet cape. "Guards! Guards!" he cries. You are intercepted by skeleton guards and executed.

"Hello, we are here for a conference on Finite Element Methods," one of the card players says in English. You speak English and ask them what game they are playing. "It's called Set," the player says. "It's really easy to learn!" You learn the game and spend a pleasant time talking to the two men. After the bar closes, you invite the men back to your hotel room and continue playing - it's so addictive! Years pass, you spend so much time playing Set that you stop being invited to social events and you also lose your job. It's a lonely life and you die destitute, next to a flabby injured bird that got stuck in a drain.

# 34
You go to the reception desk and see a man in a smart suit. You recognise him from years ago, from your university days. He was at the party where you all got caught in the act of defacing the chancellor's car with Latin puns. You never saw him after that party. He smiles as he sees you. You ask him where he's been all this time. "The evening when we all got busted, I became a pirate's butler," he begins to explain. "Some Somalians kidnapped me and made me work as a butler on their ships, hence the suit," he says, moving his hand in a demonstrative gesture from near his shoulder down to below his hip to emphasise his clothes.
"Let's go and catch up!" => 40
"Well it was great to see you!" (return to your room) => 41

# 35
"Well if he won't give his name then I won't come down to see him," you say. There is a pause. The receptionist relays more information. "He says it is very important that you see him."
"Oh, all right then." (go downstairs) => 34
"No, I'm fine here thank you." => 42

"I'm sorry but I can't let you go," the man says. Somali pirates begin to swarm the lobby. "They said they would let me go if I could find someone to replace me!" he explains. "The work's not so bad, you get used to the conditions!" You serve for 10 years as a pirate's butler under difficult conditions. They say they will let you go if you can find someone to replace you. You can't think of anyone to replace you except for the man you met in the lobby, but the pirates say it has to be someone new. "The old chancellor at my university?" you suggest. "He's too old," the pirates reply. As you cannot think of anyone to replace you, you work as a butler until you are too old to work, whereupon the pirates make you walk the plank.

Soon afterwards there is a knocking at the door. "Please let me in, I'm the person who runs the company that makes the software you like most," the man says. You look through the peephole and it is true! You let them in. "If only you had met me downstairs, I had a business proposition for you that could have made us both billionaires! I've forgotten what it is now - maybe murdering you will bring it back." Before you can protest they have shot you in the chest and left.

The ghost thanks you and gives you a commemorative medallion, before vanishing before your very eyes.
